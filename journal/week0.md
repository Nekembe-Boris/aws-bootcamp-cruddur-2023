###  1. Create an Admin User

i. Log into your AWS account as **Root User**  
ii. Search and select **IAM (Identiity and Access Management) service**  
iii. Click **Users** on the dashboard on the left side of the screen and select **Create User**  
iv. Enter the new user name and specify if you want such a user to have Console access by selecting **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console** and then **I want to create an IAM user**, create a password for the user and ensure that they change the password after 1st login session
